# Hello,
I am a PhD candidate in the Desplan lab at New York University. I study genetic 
programs that specify different kind of neurons in development. Using fly visual 
system as my model, I aim to learn how important regulators, like those implicated 
in spatial and temporal patterning, interacts and defines neuronal fates in development.
