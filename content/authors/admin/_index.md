## R Workshop for NYU SURP is

a 10-session workshop focused on data exploration, visualization, and 
hypothesis testing. Taking advantage of the simple yet powerful tools 
developed by the R community, we aim to provide a lever to explore the 
ever-growing mass of data in biology and to develop insight by generating and 
testing hypotheses with various visualization and statistical techniques.
